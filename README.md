This is a module that contains content and implementations of [Benjamin Huffman's Critical Hits Revisited](https://sterlingvermin.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/critical-hits-revisited.pdf)

It contains three compendium packs: Critical Hits Revisited (tables, macros, effects) which all must be imported in order to use.

There are two macros available, one that puts a chat message requiring the module [Requestor](https://github.com/krbz999/requestor) to give players the option to pick a damage table to roll, and one that creates a popup for the user running the macro.

All effects are stored inside of a Critical Effects object and are referenced by the tables. Not all effects are automated, only ones that could be easily added using midi-qol and chris's premades.
